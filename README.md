I developed this project with the intention of bringing together simple systems and algorithms that cover the basics of the Rust programming language. 

It was made to help anyone who want to explore more practical code examples. The repository contains a variety of projects, from simple "Hello, World!" to more advanced concepts, such as data structures and algorithms.
